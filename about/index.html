	<p> This is my personal page, which is an outlet for snippets of my work and writing.</p>
	
    <p> I am currently working in data science consulting, so you can expect posts covering topics 
    across the data science pipeline. I tend to code in Python, so that language will be a particular focus.</p>
    
    <p> Outside of data science my main interest is climate change, an area I worked in for a couple of years. I hope to 
        find opportunities to write about data science and climate change in the same post.</p>
